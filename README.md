# Month 2 â€“ Data Analysis and Statistical Methods

This repository contains the materials and deliverables for **Month 2** of the Data Science training program, covering **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Statistical Methods, Machine Learning, and Model Evaluation & Tuning**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

* Understand Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and statistical methods.
* Perform hypothesis testing and basic statistical analysis using Python libraries.
* Implement basic machine learning models and evaluate their performance.

---

## ðŸ“… Week-wise Breakdown

### Week 5 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* **Theory:** Importance of EDA, techniques for summarizing datasets, descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).
* **Hands-On:** Perform EDA on datasets (summary statistics, correlation analysis, visualizations).
* **Client Project:** EDA on a client-provided dataset, extract insights.
* **Deliverables:** Python script, EDA report (summary statistics, visualizations).

### Week 6 â€“ Probability and Statistical Testing

* **Theory:** Probability distributions (Normal, Poisson), hypothesis testing (t-test, chi-squared), confidence intervals.
* **Hands-On:** Simulate probability distributions with NumPy, perform hypothesis testing using SciPy.
* **Client Project:** Compare two business strategies using statistical analysis.
* **Deliverables:** Python script, statistical analysis report.

### Week 7 â€“ Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)

* **Theory:** Supervised vs. unsupervised learning, regression, classification, clustering, scikit-learn basics.
* **Hands-On:** Implement a basic Linear Regression model.
* **Client Project:** Predict client data (e.g., house prices) using ML.
* **Deliverables:** Python script, model file, summary of concepts learned.

### Week 8 â€“ Model Evaluation and Tuning

* **Theory:** Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV).
* **Hands-On:** Evaluate Logistic Regression or similar models using metrics and GridSearchCV.
* **Client Project:** Tune a model to improve performance.
* **Deliverables:** Python script, evaluation metrics, summary report.
